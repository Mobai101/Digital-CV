#### Description:

This is a webpage that showcases all of my personal projects that I have done in my journey to learn how to program. This is something that I have learnt that everyone who is trying to get into programming will need to have one in order to impress the employers.

The project was created using ReactJS, a front-end JavaScript library that made creating a website easier and more managable. I decided to use ReactJS because I want to show potential employers that I know how to use ReactJS instead of just using plain JavaScript. ReactJS also made it easier to manage and update the website in the future.

The project folder was separated into a few different folder, most notably is the src folder, containing all the source code of the project and the components folder which holds all the components of the website that then will be merged together by ReactJS into a complete webpage. Each component is a section of the webpage, going from top to bottom, they will be: banner - about - experience - projects - interest - reference.

The utils folder contains components that are not specific to any section of the webpage but is used throughout the webpage as utilities. In the case of my project, this folder only contains the Container util which is a wrapper component to makes every section of the webpage have a fixed width when viewing the webpage from a desktop device.

The other folders and files in the project such as the public folder or the package.json file are for nodeJS to fetch dependancies when needed so the project can work on any devices.

The project is deployed to firebase, which is a google hosting service which also has a free tier for people like me to host our own small project without any additional cost.
